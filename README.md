Only one repository could B

I'm B. I was intending on going to school for some software development classes but have chose to learn some programming languages outside of a formal school. I previously obtained a associates degree in Business Management. I really enjoyed the learning environment. However a lot my classes were taken online or hybrid(on campus a one to three days then the rest online.) There are mor than one reason why I'm interested in learning how to program. A couple of them are wanting to learn a skill, my personality, and I believe it to have more flexibility than other occupations.
