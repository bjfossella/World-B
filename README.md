I'm B. I was intending on going to school for some software development classes but have chose to learn some programming languages outside of a formal school. I previously obtained a associates degree in Business Management. I really enjoyed the learning environment. However a lot my classes were taken online or hybrid(on campus a one to three days then the rest online.) Part of the reason that I chose to take an alternate approach to learning to program is because of the amount of debt I didn't want to take on by going back to school. Thus learning from how my onling and hybrid classes were structured I plan on using that as a basis to create a structure to learn from home. There are more than one reason why I'm interested in learning how to program. A couple of them are wanting to learn a skill, my personality, and I believe it to have more flexibility than other occupations.

Some more personal things about me are I like pizza. I believe you should stick to peporoni and all meat pizzas for the most part. I make some good smoothies. I can cook breakfast like a champ. And I've been known to throw down some baked goods around the holidays.

I've been a gamer all my life and its pretty much been my passion since I got an original Nintendo back in the late eighties or early ninties. I tended to stick to certain games for long periods. I started off with the basics like Mario, Duck Hunt, and Excitebike. As I got older I got into Role Playing Games like Final Fantasy. From there I got into Madden NFL for about 20 years. Still enjoy playing it when my friends have a chance. Finally, I ended up playing multiplayer games. Starting with First Person Shooters like Socom, Rainbow Six, and Call of Duty. Then I got into League of Legends. I nearly played that exclusively peppered with a previouly mentioned genre here and there. More recently though I've tried branch back out into other games. H1z1 commanded my attention after I bought it on a Steam sale. I've also enjoyed playing Tomb Raider and a couple hours of Metal Gear Solid V.

Beyond gaming I enjoy learning, art(drawing, digital painting, etc), reading, and playing Dungeons & Dragons when I can get a consistent group. I have about two hundred plus books on my book shelf and about fourteen hundred comic books in my collection. Some of my goals have are to pull away from gaming and use that time to focus on art and programming. As you can see gaming has been a big part of my life and I wish to put my attention to a new passion. The measurement that is thrown around for expertise is ten thousand hours; which works out to be around fourty hours a week over five years. Using those standards I'm at minimum an expert in playing videogames. In hopes to acquire an "expertise" in a new field I must pull away from previous time blocks in my day with gaming being the lowest priority on the totem pole.

Anyhow, I just want to focus on learning and creating.
